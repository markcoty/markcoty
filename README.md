## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Mark, an up-and-coming data inference and analytics specialist from Atlanta, GA, USA.

- I have over 20 years of experience teaching high school and college mathematics.
- I have over 12 years experience managing teams of math and English authors for a major US test-prep company.
- My undergraduate degree is in philosophy, and I specialized in mathematical logic, set theory, and metamathematics.
- My masters degree is in math education, and this is where I added my background in statistics.
- I am currently working on adding projects from The Forage to my portfolio, and then I will be doing work simulations with Chingu.
- Finally, my goal is to land a local or remote position in data science.

- Please feel free to browse my projects and send feedback!

  Best,
  Mark
