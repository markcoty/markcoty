- I have over 20 years of experience teaching college mathematics.
- I have over 12 years experience managing teams of math and English authors for a major US test-prep company.
- My undergraduate degree is in philosophy, and I specialized in mathematical logic, set theory, and metamathematics.
- My masters degree is in math education, and this is where I added my background in statistics.
